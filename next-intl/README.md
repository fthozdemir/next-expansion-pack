# Next-Intl internalizaton

This expansion will install and configure next-intl with localized pathnames and strictly typed locales. next-intl is a large and complex library, so you may want to look at the documentation for more details: [next-int docs](https://next-intl-docs.vercel.app/)

## Installation

```bash
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fthozdemir/next-expansion-pack/main/next-intl/trigger.sh | bash -s
```

#### Note

You can find the next-intl files in this repo for manual implementation. If you receive a warning about a file already existing during installation, consider resolving the conflict manually.
